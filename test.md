### Input (Recipe Outline):

**Intro**

A classic Victoria Sandwich Cake—sometimes simply called a Victoria Sponge—is traditionally composed of two light, buttery sponge layers with a layer of jam (and often lightly sweetened whipped cream) in between. Here are some characteristics of a well-made Victoria Sandwich Cake:

Light and Tender Texture

A perfect Victoria Sponge should be airy and delicate. It’s typically achieved by creaming the butter and sugar thoroughly to incorporate air and then gently folding in the flour. Over-mixing can lead to a dense result, so a fine, even crumb that almost melts in the mouth is the mark of success.
Even Rise

Both layers should have a uniform rise and a level top. Slight doming can occur, but you shouldn’t see major peaks or valleys. This symmetry is part of the cake’s classic presentation.
Balanced Sweetness

The sponge itself should taste buttery with a subtle sweetness. The addition of a layer of fruit jam (often raspberry or strawberry) and sometimes whipped cream provides extra flavor, but the overall sweetness should remain moderate rather than cloying.
Attractive Golden Exterior

The exterior color should be a light golden brown—indicating it’s perfectly baked. Over-baking leads to a dark, dry crust, whereas under-baking can result in a sunken center or gummy texture.
Layer of Vibrant Jam (and Cream)

A thin but noticeable layer of bright jam brings sweetness and moisture. If cream is used, it should be freshly whipped and stable enough that it doesn’t ooze or collapse. The jam and cream layers should be distributed evenly to avoid a dry bite or an overly rich mouthful of filling.
Delicate Crumb Surface

When you slice into the sponge, you should see a soft interior that holds its shape without crumbling excessively. It should be easy to cut cleanly into slices.
Minimal Decoration

The traditional approach is to keep it simple: a dusting of caster sugar on top is all that’s needed. The unfussy decoration underscores the emphasis on taste and texture rather than elaborate adornment.
In summary, a Victoria Sandwich Cake is prized for its tenderness, buttery sweetness, and the perfect balance of jam and cream. It’s a simple yet elegant classic that relies on well-executed baking techniques to let the quality of the ingredients shine.

Victoria Sandwich Cake Recipe
Thought for 1m 16s
Below is a tried-and-true recipe for a classic Victoria Sponge (also called a Victoria Sandwich), along with tips to ensure success every step of the way:

Ingredients
(Makes one 2-layer, 8-inch/20 cm cake)

For the Sponge

227 g (1 cup) unsalted butter, softened
227 g (1 cup) caster sugar (superfine sugar)
4 large eggs, at room temperature
227 g (about 1¾ cups) self-raising flour, sifted
If you don’t have self-raising flour, use 225 g (about 1¾ cups) all-purpose flour plus 2 tsp baking powder.
1 tsp vanilla extract (optional, but recommended for added flavor)
Pinch of salt (if using unsalted butter)
For the Filling

4–6 tbsp raspberry or strawberry jam (choose a high-quality jam for the best flavor)
150 ml (about ½ cup to ⅔ cup) double cream or heavy whipping cream, whipped to soft peaks (optional but classic in many versions)
Alternatively, you can use buttercream or simply jam by itself.
For the Topping

A light dusting of caster sugar (or icing sugar/powdered sugar)
Equipment
Two 8-inch (20 cm) round cake tins (sponge pans)
Parchment paper (optional, but helpful for lining pans)
Mixing bowl(s) and spatula or stand mixer/hand mixer
Wire cooling rack
Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Preheat and Prepare
   Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
   Grease your two 8-inch round cake tins with butter (or line the base with parchment paper) to prevent sticking.
2. Cream Butter and Sugar
   In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and caster sugar together until the mixture is pale and fluffy.
   Tip: This can be done by hand with a wooden spoon or more quickly with an electric mixer. Proper creaming incorporates air, which helps create a light, airy sponge.
3. Add Eggs and Flavoring
   Crack the eggs into a separate small bowl to check for shells or freshness.
   Add the eggs one at a time to the creamed butter-sugar mixture, beating well after each addition.
   Tip: If the mixture appears to curdle, add a spoonful of the flour to help bring it back together.
   Stir in the vanilla extract (if using).
4. Fold in the Flour
   Sift the self-raising flour (or your flour + baking powder mixture) over the wet ingredients.
   Gently fold the flour into the batter using a spatula or large metal spoon. Use a light hand to avoid knocking out the air you’ve worked in.
   Tip: Fold in a figure-eight motion or use broad, gentle strokes around the bowl.
5. Check Consistency
   The finished batter should be smooth and drop from the spoon in a soft, slow flow—often referred to as “dropping consistency.”
   Tip: If it’s too thick, add 1–2 teaspoons of milk at a time until it reaches the right consistency. If it’s too thin, sift in a bit more flour.
6. Divide and Bake
   Evenly divide the batter between the two prepared cake tins.
   Smooth the tops gently with a spatula.
   Place the tins on the middle shelf of your preheated oven and bake for 20–25 minutes, or until:
   The sponges are risen and golden brown.
   A skewer inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs (no raw batter).
   Tip: Avoid opening the oven door too early, as this can cause the sponges to sink.
7. Cool the Sponges
   Remove from the oven and let the cakes rest in their tins for about 5 minutes to set.
   Carefully turn them out onto a wire cooling rack. Peel away any parchment if used.
   Allow them to cool completely before adding the filling. Filling a warm cake can cause whipped cream to melt and jam to seep out.
8. Whip the Cream (Optional)
   If you’re using cream, whip the double or heavy cream until it holds soft peaks. Over-whipping can result in stiff or grainy cream, so watch closely.
9. Assemble the Cake
   Place one sponge layer on your serving plate or cake stand.
   Spread the jam evenly over the surface, leaving a small border at the edges to prevent excessive seepage.
   If using whipped cream, spread or pipe the cream on top of the jam in an even layer.
   Gently place the second sponge layer on top.
   Tip: If one of your layers is slightly domed, place that layer on top, dome side down, to create a flatter top.
10. Final Touch
    Lightly dust the top with caster sugar or icing sugar.
    Your Victoria Sponge is ready to serve!
    Extra Tips for Success
    Room-Temperature Ingredients

Using butter and eggs at room temperature ensures an emulsion and helps the cake rise properly.
Measure Accurately

Weighing ingredients (especially flour) is more accurate than volume measurements, leading to consistent results.
Even Cooking

If one cake bakes faster than the other, remove it promptly to prevent over-browning.
You can rotate tins halfway through baking if your oven has hot spots.
Flavor Options

Raspberry or strawberry jam is traditional, but other fruit jams or lemon curd also work beautifully.
You could add a bit of lemon zest or almond extract for variation, though that steers slightly away from tradition.
Storage

If filled with fresh cream, the cake is best eaten on the same day or stored in the fridge for up to 2 days (cream may lose volume).
If filled only with jam, the cake will keep well at room temperature in an airtight container for 2–3 days.
Enjoy your light, buttery, jam-filled delight! A well-made Victoria Sandwich Cake is beautifully simple, letting the soft sponge and vibrant jam be the stars of the show.

Whipping Cream Tips
Thought for 1m 33s
Whipped cream is often used as a filling in a Victoria Sandwich Cake, and ensuring it stays in shape is key to a neat, attractive presentation. Here are some detailed tips to help you whip cream that’s stable and holds its form:

1. Start with Cold Cream and Cold Equipment
   Chill the Cream Properly

Always start with well-chilled heavy or double cream (at least 30–36% fat content).
Place your unopened carton of cream at the back of the fridge overnight to ensure it’s thoroughly cold.
Chill the Bowl and Whisk

Pop the mixing bowl and whisk (or beaters) into the fridge or freezer for a few minutes before whipping.
Cold tools help the cream whip faster and hold its peaks better. 2. Choose the Right Cream
Heavy/Double Cream
Look for a cream labeled as “heavy cream,” “double cream,” or “whipping cream” with at least 30% fat. Lower-fat creams (like half-and-half) won’t whip to stiff peaks.
Avoid Ultra-High-Temperature (UHT) Creams If Possible
UHT or ultra-pasteurized creams can be more challenging to whip to a stable consistency (though still possible); fresh, pasteurized cream gives the best results in terms of stability and flavor. 3. Whip Gradually
Start Slowly

Begin whipping at a low speed to incorporate some air without splashing. After about 30 seconds to 1 minute, increase to a medium or medium-high speed.
Whipping too fast from the start can lead to uneven texture and a higher risk of overwhipping.
Monitor Progress

Keep an eye on the cream as it thickens. It goes from liquid to fluffy peaks faster than you might expect, and going too far will create grainy or curdled-looking cream. 4. Add a Stabilizer (Optional, but Helpful)
To help whipped cream hold its shape for longer (especially if the cake won’t be served immediately), consider adding a stabilizer:

Powdered Sugar (Confectioners’ Sugar)

Replace part (or all) of the granulated sugar with powdered sugar. The cornstarch in powdered sugar can help stabilize the cream.
Typically, 1–3 tablespoons of powdered sugar per cup (240 ml) of cream is enough, depending on how sweet you like it.
Cornstarch Slurry

Dissolve 1 teaspoon of cornstarch in a small amount of cold cream or water, then gently stir it into the cream about halfway through whipping. This thickens the cream without significantly altering the taste.
Gelatin

Bloom 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin in 1 tablespoon cold water for 5 minutes, then gently warm it until dissolved. Let it cool slightly, then drizzle into the cream near the soft-peak stage. Continue whipping to desired consistency. This creates a more stable whipped cream that holds up in warmer conditions.
Instant Pudding Mix

Add 1–2 tablespoons of vanilla (or complementary flavor) instant pudding mix per cup of cream while whipping. This method sweetens and thickens the cream. 5. Whip to the Right Stage
Soft Peaks
The cream forms gentle mounds when you lift the whisk, and the peak folds over softly at the tip. This is typically enough for folding into desserts or adding just a light layer in a cake.
Medium-Stiff Peaks
The cream stands up but the peaks gently curl at the tip. This is often ideal for cake fillings and piping—firm enough to hold shape, but still smooth and not grainy.
Avoid Overwhipping
If the cream becomes clumpy or appears grainy, you’ve gone too far. You can sometimes save slightly overwhipped cream by gently folding in a little more liquid cream to loosen it. 6. Assemble the Cake Promptly
Fill the Cake Soon After Whipping
Whipped cream can start to deflate if left sitting out for too long. For the most stable filling, whip the cream as close as possible to assembly time, especially if you’re not using a stabilizer.
Keep it Cool
If you’re not serving the cake immediately, store it in the fridge until you’re ready. This will prolong the whipped cream’s shape and freshness. 7. Serve and Store
Serve the Same Day
A Victoria Sponge with whipped cream is best eaten the same day it’s assembled, as the cream can soften and the cake may absorb some moisture.
Refrigerate Leftovers
Wrap or cover the cake and keep it refrigerated. It should hold for up to 2 days (though the cream may lose volume gradually).
Quick Stabilized Whipped Cream Recipe Example
240 ml (1 cup) cold heavy cream
1–2 tablespoons powdered sugar (or granulated sugar)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
1 teaspoon cornstarch (optional, for extra stability)
Chill bowl and whisk.
Start whipping cream, sugar, and vanilla on low.
Once cream begins to thicken, sprinkle in cornstarch.
Increase speed to medium until medium-stiff peaks form.
This ensures a fluffier, more stable whipped cream perfect for your Victoria Sandwich.

With these tips, your whipped cream should stay light, airy, and stable, giving you a beautiful and delicious filling that complements the tender sponge of your Victoria Sandwich Cake perfectly!

Cara-cara untuk base kek:

1. Potong butter pada kiub kecil dan biarkan lembut pada suhu bilik.
2. Ambil sehelai kertas parchment yang lebih besar daripada saiz loyang
3. Lipat kertas hingga membentuk segitiga yang panjang dan runcing di hujung.
4. Ukuran dengan loyang, letakkan hujung runcing segitiga di tengah dasar loyang.
5. Gunting kertas mengikut saiz loyang. Apabila anda membuka lipatan, kertas parchment akan menjadi bulatan sempurna yang sesuai dengan dasar loyang
6. Sapu mentega pada dua loyang bulat berukuran 20cm dan alas dasar dengan kertas parchment.
7. Pecahkan 4 biji telur
8. Ayak tepung gandum dan baking powder.
9. Sukat 1 sb madu.
10. Dalam mangkuk besar, pukul mentega dan gula kastor hingga gebu dan pucat. Gunakan pemukul elektrik untuk hasil terbaik (3-5 minit).
11. Kaup tepi-tepi mangkuk.
12. Tambah esen vanila dan madu, sambung putar.
13. Tambahkan telur satu per satu sambil terus memukul. Jika adunan kelihatan terpisah, tambahkan satu sudu tepung naik sendiri untuk mengikatnya semula.
14. Masukkan tepung yang diayak sedikit demi sedikit. kacau hingga sebati. Jangan terlebih kacau untuk memastikan kek kekal gebu.
15. Bahagikan adunan sama rata ke dalam dua loyang. Ratakan permukaan dengan spatula.
16. Bakar selama 20-25 minit atau hingga kek naik dan permukaan keemasan. Uji dengan lidi; jika lidi keluar bersih, kek telah masak.
17. Keluarkan kek dari ketuhar dan biarkan dalam loyang selama 5 minit.
18. Kemudian, pindahkan ke atas rak penyejuk dan biarkan sejuk sepenuhnya.

Cara-cara penyediaan whipping cream:

1. Pastikan krim putar berada dalam keadaan sangat sejuk (dari peti sejuk, bukan peti beku).
2. Letakkan mangkuk dan whisk dalam peti sejuk selama 10-15 minit sebelum digunakan.
3. Tuangkan krim putar ke dalam mangkuk sejuk dan pukul krim putar hingga kental.
4. tambahkan gula aising ketika krim mula pekat.
5. Teruskan memukul sehingga terbentuk puncak lembut (soft peaks). Berhenti memukul sebaik sahaja puncak keras terbentuk, kerana memukul terlalu lama boleh menyebabkan krim menjadi berbutir dan berpisah.
6. Pindah masuk dalam pipping bag.

Cara-cara untuk hias kek:

1. Pipekan whipping cream. Sapukan jem strawberi di atasnya secara rata.
2. Letakkan lapisan kek kedua di atasnya.
